#+TITLE: Estimation of DoA using Information Theory
#+AUTHOR: Jayesh Kumar Gupta

* Assumption
- Gaussian
- Information Theoretical measure

* Need
- multiple reflections (reverberations)

* Problem  

* GCC method
- time delay estimation
I think we have the input from [[file:generate.m]]. Then use file:gcc_phat.m to find \Tau
* BSS (blind source separation)  

* Proposed method
- Maximizing Mutual information comparing function
